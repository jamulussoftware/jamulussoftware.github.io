      <h2>What is Jamulus?</h2>
      Jamulus is for playing, rehearsing, or just jamming with your friends, your band or just anyone you find online. Use your Windows, macOS or Linux machine to connect to Jamulus servers worldwide, for free over a normal broadband
      connection. Or
      host your own private server. Jamulus is designed for high quality, low-latency sound, making it easy to play together remotely and in time. Have a look at <a href="wiki/Demos" target="_blank"

     <h2>Jamulus worldwide</h2>
    All over the world Jamulus allows huge choirs to sing, loud rock bands to play, and brings folk and classical musicians together. It's being used for remote music lessons,
    in schools and universities, in private and in public. Even just for the spoken word – all in real time on the Internet, as if you were there in person.
