# Server Types

You can run your server in one of three "modes" (either at home or on a 3rd party host):

### 1. Public
Your server will be listed in the [directory server](Directory-Servers) list that clients use by default. Musicians can then discover and connect to your server.  It is not necessary to run as a public server since many other people already run them. Just connect to one with low latency and start jamming.

This mode is activated by checking the "Register my server..." checkbox and (optionally) entering your server information.

When running without the GUI ("headless"), the following would configure a public server:

~~~
Jamulus --nogui --server \
        --centralserver genreServer:port \
        --serverinfo "yourServerName;yourCity;[country ID]"
~~~

**Note**: It is **not** necessary to port-forward or otherwise configure your router to run a public server.

See also [Command Line Options](Command-Line-Options) for other parameters you can set.


### 2. Private
This type of server will not be listed on a directory server list. You must give musicians your server address to connect their clients to. See [Running a Private Server](Running-a-Private-Server) for what needs to be done to enable others to connect to it.

This mode is activated by un-checking "Register my server...".

When running without the GUI ("headless"), the following would configure a private server:

```shell
Jamulus --nogui --server
```

See also [Command Line Options](Command-Line-Options) for other parameters you can set.

### 3. Directory
Configuring your server as a Directory Server need only be done under special circumstances (e.g. for online events or musical associations). Most people can ignore this type.

To view servers listed by a custom directory server, musicians must enter the address in their clientâ€™s "Custom Directory Server" settings field.  They will then see a Connection Setup list which is generated by that directory server.

Normal server operators can also register with your custom directory server so their servers can show up in your server list by setting yours as their `--centralserver` option.

To run a server as a Directory Server, it should be configured with `--centralserver localhost` (that is, specify itself as the directory server to query).

#### Configuration points to note

If you want to control which servers can register with your Directory Server, you can enable a whitelist with the `--listfilter` command line option. See the [command line options page](Command-Line-Options) for further information about this feature and other parameters you can set.

When running a public Directory Server behind a NAT firewall on a private network, use the `--serverpublicip` option to specify the public IP address of the server(s) being listed by your Directory Server. This is necessary to allow clients on the public Internet to connect to them via NAT. Note that for the servers using this option, you will still need proper port forwarding in your router/firewall.
