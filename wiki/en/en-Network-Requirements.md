# Network Requirements

## Audio bandwidth

The audio settings have an impact on the required network bandwidth. The below table summarises network requirements with respect to the configuration of:
* Channels : stereo/mono
* Quality : high/medium/low
* Audio buffer duration : 2.67 ms, 5.33 ms, 10.67 ms, 21.33 ms

With the following units
* ms : milliseconds
* Kbit/s : Kilo-bits per second (Reminder : 1 Mbit/s = 1024 Kbit/s, 1 KByte/s = 8 Kbit/s)
* Mbit/s : Mega-bits per second

| Channels  | Quality | Bandwidth (for buffer : 2.67 ms) |  Bandwidth (for buffer : 5.33ms) | Bandwidth (for buffer : 10.67 ms) | Bandwidth (for buffer : 21.33 ms) |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Stereo    | High   | 894 Kbit/s | 657 Kbit/s | 541 Kbit/s | 483 Kbit/s |
| Stereo    | Medium | 672 Kbit/s | 444 Kbit/s | 328 Kbit/s | 270 Kbit/s |
| Stereo    | Low    | 606 Kbit/s | 372 Kbit/s | 256 Kbit/s | 198 Kbit/s |
| Mono      | High   | 672 Kbit/s | 444 Kbit/s | 328 Kbit/s | 270 Kbit/s |
| Mono      | Medium | 594 Kbit/s | 366 Kbit/s | 250 Kbit/s | 192 Kbit/s |
| Mono      | Low    | 534 Kbit/s | 306 Kbit/s | 190 Kbit/s | 132 Kbit/s |

## Network bandwidth

There is one upstream (musician sending to the server) and one downstream (server sending back the mix to the musician)

Note also that mean ADSL2 transfer rate is 10 Mbit/s for downstream and 1 Mbit/s for upstream. The actual performance depends on distance to the provider, which may [theoretically range from 24 Mbit/s at 0.3km to 1.5 Mbit/s at 5.2km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line) for download rate.
