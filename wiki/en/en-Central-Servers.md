# Public Server Registration

Because there is a limit of 150 servers per central server, you need to select which central server you want to advertise your server on. Select a genre if you intend to limit players to that style (players can then see your server in their genre list). 

When you start a public server, you will see a message saying whether your server has been successfully listed or not. If not, and you leave your server running, it will re-try its attempts to register until a free slot becomes available.  


## Headless servers

Set central (genre) server using the `--centralserver` (`-e`) option as folos:
