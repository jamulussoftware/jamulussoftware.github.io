# Jamulus on-boarding
Let's have a look at what Jamulus looks like and what you should do after having installed the software.
## First start
Before you start Jamulus:
1. For now, **close all other applications**. It's best to start from zero at first.
2. **Connect everything** (Ethernet cable, audio gear, etc.)

... to *minimise load* on your computer and to ensure that *no other application* tries to use your sound card.

You can have a look at [Hardware Setup](Hardware-Setup) for more information on what to do with your equipment. If you need help setting up ASIO4All on Windows, have a look at the [ASIO4All Setup guide on the Windows installation page](Installation-for-Windows#setting-up-asio4all).

### Jamulus main window
When you open Jamulus, you will see a window which looks like this:

### 1. Setting up a profile
To let others know who you are, you should set up your *profile*. To do so, click on "View" (bar on the top)>"My Profile..."
Now you will see this:

Fill in at least "Alias/Name" to set your name and close the window.

### 2. Connecting to a server
Now you are set up, you can use the "Connect" button in the Jamulus main window to join a server. A window will now open in which you can find *servers grouped by genre*. To select another genre, select one from the list in the top left. After having selected a genre and server, join a server by clicking on "Connect". If you have problems here, they are most likely due to wrongly configured audio gear or network issues. Have a look at the [Troubleshooting page](Client-Troubleshooting).
### The first Jam
Congrats! You can now start jamming with Jamulus. The sliders you see on the right are your own personal mix. Everything you change here will change what you hear, but won't affect others. If you move a slider down, that user will be quieter, if you move it up, that user will be louder for you.

If you don't want others to hear your audio, click on "Mute Myself" (left to your personal mix) which will stop your audio from being sent to other musicians.

While we're already here: "Settings" opens – of course – the settings window with all the audio settings which you probably want to change for your needs.

More information about using Jamulus can be found in the [Software Manual](Software-Manual).
