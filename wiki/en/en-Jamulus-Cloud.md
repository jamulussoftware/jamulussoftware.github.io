# Jamulus in the Cloud

Jamulus user [skrul](https://sourceforge.net/u/skrulx/profile/) has put up some public EC2 AMIs of Ubuntu 18.04 running Jamulus. 


Launch an instance from the AMI in the region you want (you can use use m3.small) and make sure you add the "All UDP / Anywhere" rule to the security group before launching.


**Note as of April 2020**: These instances come with Jamulus v3.5.0. Before running your server, you are strongly advised to [check the current release](https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/releases) and upgrade to that.
