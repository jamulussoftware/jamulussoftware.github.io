# Compiling Jamulus from Source

## Linux

Please refer to the [client installation page](Installation-for-Linux) or these instructions if you wish to [compile a headless server](Server-Linux#running-a-headless-server)

## macOS
You don't need to compile Jamulus for macOS since we provide official binaries, but if you really want to, follow the instructions below.
### Requirements

1. Install XCode
1. Install Qt as follow

```shell
brew install qt5
brew link qt5 --force
```

### Build project

#### Generate XCode Project file
```shell
qmake -spec macx-xcode Jamulus.pro
```

#### Print build targets and configuration in console
```shell
xcodebuild -list -project Jamulus.xcodeproj
```
will prompt
```shell
Targets:
    Jamulus
    Qt Preprocess

Build Configurations:
    Debug
    Release

If no build configuration is specified and -scheme is not passed then "Release" is used.

Schemes:
    Jamulus
```

#### Build the project

```shell
xcodebuild build
```

Will build the file and make it available in `./Release/Jamulus.app`


## Windows
You don't need to compile Jamulus for Windows since we provide official binaries, but if you really want to, follow the instructions below.

**Required software**: [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download), a compiler like Visual Studio, ASIO development files

- get the Jamulus source code e.g. via git or via zip download from the Jamulus Repo
- get and copy the [ASIOSDK](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html) development files in `[\path\to\jamulus\source]\windows` directory so that, e.g., the
  directory `[\path\to\jamulus\source]\ASIOSDK2\common` exists
- open Jamulus.pro in Qt Creator then compile & run


## General notes

### The "headless" build flag

Compiling with the `headless` flag means you can avoid installing some of the dependent packages, save some disk space and/or speed up your build time under the following circumstances:

1. If you plan to run Jamulus on Gentoo Linux, the only packages you should need for a headless build are `qtcore`, `qtnetwork`, `qtconcurrent` and `qtxml` (both for building and running the server).

1. If you are running Jamulus on Ubuntu/Debian, you will need all dependent packages to **compile** the binary, but to **run** the resulting headless Jamulus server you should only need `libqt5core5a`, `libqt5network5`, `libqt5xml5` and probably `libqt5concurrent5`. This may be useful for compiling/upgrading on one machine to run the binary on another (a Raspberry Pi, for example).

1. Note that if you want to compile a GUI client on one machine and run it on another (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) you only need the dependencies listed for a [headless server](Server-Linux#running-a-headless-server) (see point above), only _with_ the JACK sound libraries.
