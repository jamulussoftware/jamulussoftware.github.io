# Contributing to the Jamulus Project

If you find a mistake, typo or something out of date (in any language) on this website or in Jamulus itself, you can <a href="https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/issues">raise it as a bug</a>.

If you think some documentation or information is missing or can be improved, <a href="https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions">post about that on this forum</a> so that it can be discussed first.

If you want to help out with translation, you will need to have a GitHub account and be familiar with using git and Jekyll. Read about our [documentation and translation process](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamuluswebsite/blob/changes/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [introduce yourself](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions) if youâ€™d like to get involved.
