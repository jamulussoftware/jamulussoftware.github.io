# Contributing to the Jamulus Project

## Jamulus Software
* If you want to contribute code, post your idea on [the developer forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/llcon/discussion/developerforum/) first so that it can be discussed before making a pull request (be sure to read main dev's [Volker's manifesto for contributions](https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/issues/596))

See the [Jamulus GitHub repo](https://github.com/corrados/jamulus) for further information.

## Jamulus Website

* If you find a mistake, typo or something out of date (in any language) on the website, you can [raise it as an issue here](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamuluswebsite/issues).

* If you think some documentation or information is missing or can be improved, post about that on [the relevant discussion forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/llcon/discussion/) so that it can be discussed first.

Pull requests for the website should look like this:

`[language code (e.g. en)] {short description of your changes}`

See the [Website GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamuluswebsite) for further information.
