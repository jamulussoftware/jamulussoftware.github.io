_**The exact method of connecting your instrument will of course vary depending on your hardware.**_

## Windows: Audio interface connection - ASIO4All

### 1. Plug the interface into a USB port on your computer

In the future, always use the same USB port for the audio device.

**Windows users**: If not already done: download and install the [free ASIO sound driver (ASIO4All)](https://www.asio4all.org){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Some people have also reported success using [this ASIO native driver](http://www.behringerdownload.de/_software/BEHRINGER_2902_X64_2.8.40.zip){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} __currently not available__, although it's not listed on Behringer's product pages as of April 2020.


### 2. Start Jamulus

Configure Jamulus to use the correct sound setup (see [this excellent guide](https://www.facebook.com/notes/jamulus-online-musicianssingers-jamming/idiots-guide-to-jamulus-app/510044532903831/) by [Simon Tomlinson](https://www.facebook.com/simon.james.tomlinson?eid=ARBQoY3KcZAtS3pGdLJuqvQTeRSOo4gHdQZT7nNzOt1oPMGgZ4_3GERe-rOyH5PxsSHVYYXjWwcqd71a) on Facebook).

Make sure you have switched off the monitor button on your Behringer U-CONTROL UCA202 (otherwise you will hear both the original sound you are sending to the Jamulus server as well as the returning sound, and may get feedback).

### 3. Plug in your instrument and headphones

Connect your instrument to the input plugs of the Behringer U-CONTROL UCA202. Plug in your headphones into the Behringer U-CONTROL UCA202.

### 4. Connect to a Jamulus server.

You're done! Have fun!
